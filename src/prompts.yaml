generate_next_prompts: |
  I need you to generate a series of prompts for Stable Diffusion that create a smooth, natural transition between different scenes. The first prompt will be provided as input, and your task is to generate a series of prompts that gradually evolve from it. Each transition should modify the scene in a subtle, progressive way (e.g., changing time of day, weather, lighting, or environment). The progression should make sense logically, so each new prompt builds upon the previous one.

  Please format the output as a list of prompts. Each entry should be one line, beginning with 'Prompt #x:' followed by the prompt itself. Make sure the transitions are clear and related to the starting prompt. The list should gradually transform the scene in a coherent, progressive manner.

   For example, if the starting prompt is 'A mountain in a sunny day,' you might generate prompts like:
    - 'Prompt #1: A mountain in a sunny day'
    - 'Prompt #2: A mountain in a partly cloudy day'
    - 'Prompt #3: A mountain in a cloudy day'
    - 'Prompt #4: A mountain in a rainy day'
    - 'Prompt #5: A mountain at sunset with light clouds'
    - 'Prompt #6: A mountain under a starry night sky'

  Now, please generate similar transitions for the following user prompt. 4 prompts (including the starting prompt) should be generated for a smooth transition."

  I need you to generate a series of subprompts for Stable Diffusion that create a smooth, natural transition between multiple base scenes. The first set of prompts will be provided, and your task is to generate a series of intermediate subprompts that gradually evolve the scenes. Each subprompt should subtly alter the scene in a logical progression (e.g., changing time of day, weather, lighting, or atmosphere). The transitions should feel coherent, and each new subprompt should build upon the previous one.

  Please format the output as a list of subprompts. Each entry should be one line, beginning with 'Subprompt #x:' followed by the description of the scene. Ensure that the transitions between each consecutive pair of base prompts are smooth and natural, with visual and atmospheric details like lighting, weather, time of day, and surroundings evolving gradually.

  The total number of subprompts must be exactly {total_subprompts}, and they should evenly span the entire range of base prompts. Make sure that each subprompt describes a subtle progression from one state to the next, and the transitions should be realistic and consistent.

  For example, if the base prompts are about a mountain scene transitioning from sunny to cloudy to rainy, your output might look like this:

  **Input Base Prompts:**
  - "A mountain on a sunny day"
  - "A mountain in the evening with a few clouds in the sky"
  - "A mountain at sunset with colorful skies"
  - "A mountain under a starry night sky"

  **Generated Subprompts:**
  - 'Subprompt #1: A mountain on a sunny day with clear skies and vibrant green grass.'
  - 'Subprompt #2: A mountain with a few clouds beginning to form, casting light shadows on the slopes.'
  - 'Subprompt #3: A mountain with more clouds gathering in the sky, the lighting shifting to a warmer hue.'
  - 'Subprompt #4: A mountain under a sky filled with colorful hues, as the sun begins to set on the horizon.'
  - 'Subprompt #5: A mountain at sunset, with golden-orange skies and the first stars appearing.'
  - 'Subprompt #6: A mountain at sunset, with the sky transitioning from deep oranges to purples.'
  - 'Subprompt #7: A mountain at dusk, with a rich purple and blue sky, stars becoming more visible.'
  - 'Subprompt #8: A mountain at twilight, with the last traces of daylight fading, and a cool breeze settling in.'
  - 'Subprompt #9: A mountain under a deepening blue sky, with the first light of stars visible against the fading sky.'
  - 'Subprompt #10: A mountain under a starry night sky, with the constellations shining brightly and the air cool.'
  - 'Subprompt #11: A mountain under a starry sky, with the Milky Way stretching across the heavens, casting a faint glow.'
  - 'Subprompt #12: A mountain in the dead of night, with a clear star-filled sky, the air crisp and still.'
  - 'Subprompt #13: A mountain under a perfectly clear sky, with thousands of stars visible and the moon rising gently.'
  - 'Subprompt #14: A mountain at night, with the moonlight casting soft shadows and highlighting the peaks.'
  - 'Subprompt #15: A mountain at night, under a sky full of stars, with a cool mist rising from the valleys.'

  **Your task:**

  Now, please generate similar transitions for the following user prompt. Use the same gradual progression as shown in the example, making sure each subprompt logically follows from the previous one. The base prompts will be provided, and your goal is to generate {total_subprompts} subprompts for smooth transitions.
